  # Googlebooks-API

  ## Description
  
  This repositoy contains the refactored files for a Googlebooks API. Using Mongodb, Mongoose, Express.js API, React, and Node JS, users of this app can search through the Google books API to find books of interest and add them to their collection of saved titles for later reading. The app itself, originally built with a RESTful API, has been converted to a Graphql API built with Apollo Server.
